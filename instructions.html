      <h2>Game description</h2>
      <p>Fire broke out in the library, and a little kitten stuck there on the table. It cannot get
        out because it’s too scared to move. </p>
        <p>Fire and water drops are falling down. In order to extinguish the fire and save the kitty, you have to collect (click) 20 water drops.  When a fire drop falls on the library’s floor, it stays there and worsens the fire. On the
        other hand, water drops do not land on the floor (they disappear). A player should avoid clicking on fire drops while playing as the fire hurts them and takes away one life each time. If you have lost a life, you will get a chance to obtain another one as it will come down along with water and fire drops. You have three hearts (lives) when the game starts, and you have to have at least one by the end of the game in order to win. </p>
        <p>The game lasts 1 minute.</p>
        <p>Game is over if you did not collect enough water drops (20) in the given time OR lost all your lives by clicking on fire drops.</p>
        <p>Level is complete if you managed to collect all needed water drops without losing all your lives.</p>

      <p>Avoid clicking on firedrops as they will hurt you and take away one life every time. Remember, that the firedrops stay active even after reaching the floor, so try not to click on them.</p>
      <p>You have three lives to begin with.</p>
      <p>If you lose a life, you can get another one by clicking on a heart falling down.</p>
